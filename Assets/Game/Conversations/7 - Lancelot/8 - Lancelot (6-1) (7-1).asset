  narrative: "I appreciate the trust you have for your lords, and yet I cannot help
    but disagree with your approach to ruling the kingdom. For I don\u2019t believe
    that the lords can always be trusted to make wise decisions on their own. I have
    seen the way sir Kay and sir Bors quarrel and it is clear to me that much of
    the kingdom is overseen by confused or selfish vassals who require guidance."
