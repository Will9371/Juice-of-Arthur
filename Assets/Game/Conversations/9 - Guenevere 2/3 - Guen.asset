  narrative: I have no idea, I was just having a lesson with Lancelot and noticed
    a servant watching us. When I started to approach her she ran off.

    response: "I don\u2019t know enough about what happened. Perhaps she just lingered
      a little too long on a cursory glance in your direction, it is an easy enough
      mistake to make."
  - node: {fileID: 11400000, guid: cda1fb4850bce53459e1b705479b927e, type: 2}
    response: "Very well. I will have her banished from the kingdom without delay.
      I don\u2019t have time to investigate the matter further."

    response: In that case, I will see to it that she stand trial. I must hear her
      side of the story, and from Lancelot as well.
