  narrative: 'Bors: My lord, while I understand Kay''s concerns, the land in question
    is my birthright and has been in my family for generations. I cannot simply hand
    over control to him. It would also be a long and costly process.'

    response: 'Sir Bors, though your birthright to the land is not to be ignored,
      perhaps a temporary transfer of power is the best solution. You need to help
      Kay with this problem. '

    response: It is not for me to interfere in the affairs of my knights and lords.
      I trust that both of you will come to a resolution that serves the greater
      good and maintains the peace of our kingdom.
